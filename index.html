         Bughead is the best riverdale ship, and the main reason why the riverdale
         writer still have their job. If they brake up their relationship, then
         they will be broke. One of the the reasons why people love bughead is
         because they are a real life couple with the ship of Sprousehart. Bfore 
         lili reinhart (Betty) and cole sprouse (Jughead) started on this
         thrilling, romantic, and suspensful cw show, Betty was originally
         crushing over kj apa (archie)! As lili and cole's characters were very
         close in the sho, it ade their rlationshp for in real life too.
